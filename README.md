This repository is to serve as the long-term storage of my thesis data and project as a whole.

In-depth definitions and documentation of workflows exist within the written thesis, starting at 'Data Analysis' on page 11 and ending on page 19. The code is further annotated with notes to explain what is going on throughout each function.

Knowledge and understanding of QGIS, including the application of advanced functions and expert functions based on custom expressions, is needed to dissect this project fully.

Overall, this project is the culmination of two years of hard work in analyzing the forest products market in Wisconsin to identify existing woodsheds (think watershed but for timber production) in an effort to benefit an industry that my family has been a part of for multiple generations.
